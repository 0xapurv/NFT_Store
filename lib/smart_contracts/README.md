In this project, we have managed to create a decentralized application, on starting this app with `flutter run`, here is how the final working version will look like.

Here the user can deposit installments of ₹3 to reach a threshold of ₹12. When they do reach this threshold, we return the principal of ₹12 + interest of ₹3 = ₹15 to them. They can now withdraw the amount from this account.
